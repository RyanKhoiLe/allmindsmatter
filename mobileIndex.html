        <h3> “Our experience with All Minds Matter (AMM) has been truly exceptional. Our daughter started at AMM the fall of her 8th grade year. She had struggled the year prior with missing assignments, organization and follow through, which made it hard to achieve a GPA higher than a 2.67. Her first quarter of 8th grade, she attended AMM regularly and achieved Honor Roll. She continued to achieve Honor Roll through the 2nd quarter. and in her 3rd quarter had gained the skills to begin working at home more on her own. That quarter she got a 4.0. The fourth quarter, she did not use AMM at all, and still finished the school year making Honor Roll. In addition to her success in school, her self-esteem improved dramatically and the environment in our home was less conflictual. Her story is a testament to the quality of intervention provided by AMM. The staff at AMM teach the students the skills to be successful on their own, by providing the guidance, assistance and support the students need without being a crutch. This not only results in academic success but also in emotional confidence and increased self-esteem. Thank you so much, Caitlin and Donald for creating such a wonderful program.”

        <h3> “I just wanted to pass along my recognition of your son's amazing academic turnaround this past six weeks. The All Minds Matter program he is working with is phenomenal! But I know that even the best of programs are not effective unless a student chooses to invest himself. Your son has obviously made the decision to apply his efforts in that direction. He is attentive in class, and more often than not, he is finishing his work in class. His test scores have significantly improved with an overall B+ on our last composite assessments. I mentioned to him this past week that I was proud of his turnaround--I'm sure your family is quite delighted.”

        <h3> “AMM has done an amazing job working with our son. By building a relationship with him, they have helped him improve his grades and regain his academic confidence. Being able to tutor across several subjects and use Aeries to track assignments and grades allows them to respond quickly where more attention is needed. We check-in with Caitlin frequently to assure we are on the same page. Eliminating homework battles at home has been "priceless!”

      <h3> “In May 2010, I was accepted at Berkeley as a Legal Studies major, and will soon be preparing to apply to law school. I could not have achieved these extraordinary milestones without the counseling and support of Caitlin Hoffman. When I met Caitlin in April 2008, I was considering not continuing with my education. I struggled with academics and always seemed to fall behind. Caitlin explained to me that my education was fundamental to my future goals and assured me that I could succeed. She helped me to find a counselor in my school to administrate a learning skills test, which indicated I had certain challenges that could easily be overcome through note-taking accommodations and extended time for tests. Caitlin showed me how to navigate the school system to find academic support services such as help with math and writing. With her coaching, my GPA increased from 2.8 to my current 3.4, in three semesters. Her extensive experience in education leveraged my efforts. Caitlin held me accountable to the goals we set. She provided the support I did not find in family, teachers, or school administrators. Most importantly, she truly believed in my potential. I am forever in debt to Caitlin for investing in my success. Thank you, Caitlin, for believing in me.“
